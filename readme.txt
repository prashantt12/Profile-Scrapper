Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Prashant Tanwar


A passionate and hardworking Developer studying in MIT ADT Pune.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Web-Scraping using Python with Selenium that will be scraping information of the Twitter user profile of which we have input from the official twitter page in our project. Project works after bypassing the API restrictions given by twitter and works perfectly. The zip file contains multiple files of which there is an output file containing the scrapped information of 3 tweets from the official account of @elonmusk. All of the files redirect to main.py file which is the main file running the operation. Multiple libraries were imported for the project to work and github projects and google scholar research paper were used as references. The number of tweets as well as the profile to be scrapped can be changed as well.
